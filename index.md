### Meme Motivation 
As you can see above, this meme was inspired by **Kermit the frog**. **Kermit** is a well known muppet often featured on **Seaseme Street**. My inspiration from this meme is has two parts.
1. Firstly, I spent most my time in the holidays relaxing and working while slightly dreading uni. Then all of a sudden a couple of months go by and I'm already 3 weeks into uni ðŸ¤¡. 
  This meme is just meant to reflect how I feel in a funny yet sad way.
2. Secondly, a bit personal, but in my first year of university I remember working on a group project at around 2am and on **GoogleDocs** someone joins me. I didn't know them too well but we just randomly started
 posting Kermit memes and that led to us being friends even a few years later ðŸ˜„.
 
### Originality 
* This meme is orignial as for almost all of the Kermit memes on the _internet_ they are only one paneled reaction images. As opposed to a 4 panel Meme format which was mostly popular in 2012.
I also added a touch of originality by changing the typical impact font to serif and changing the background colour to pink!
